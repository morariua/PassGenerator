Password Generator

  This is a simple password generator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea behind the password generator is to provide users with    a secure and strong password that can be used to protect their online accounts from unauthorized access.

How it Works

  The password generator allows users to choose the length of their password and select the type of characters they want to include in their password.      The user can choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

  Once the user clicks on the "Generate Password" button, the application generates a random password based on the user's preferences. The password is      displayed in the text box, as well as a strength meter to determine if the password is secure or not. The user can then copy it to their clipboard by   clicking on the "Copy to Clipboard" button.

How to Use

  To use the password generator, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will see a simple user interface with the following elements:

  Password Length Slider: Use the slider to choose the length of your password. The length can range from 4 to 30 characters.
  Uppercase Letters Checkbox: Check this box if you want to include uppercase letters in your password.
